# Create an Azure Linux VM with Nginx using Terraform & Cloud-Init
Azure VM with Nginx using Terraform and Cloud-Init


**There will be 3 objectives for this lab:**
* Use Terraform to create the Azure Linux VM and all associated resources
* Deploy the Terraform remotely using GitHub Actions
* Destroy the resources using Terraform. 

Step 1 will take a lot of steps but luckily for me, I've already set up GitHub Actions and some Terraform code from our last deployment to expedite this process.
